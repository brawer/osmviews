# Add maintainers

To become a project maintainer, do the following:

1. Read [terms of use](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Toolforge/Quickstart#Read_and_agree_to_terms_of_use) for Wikimedia Toolforge.

2. Create a [Wikimedia developer account](https://toolsadmin.wikimedia.org/register/) if you haven’t one already.

3. File a [Toolforge membership request](https://toolsadmin.wikimedia.org/tools/), write “I’d like to join the OSMViews project” as explanation. Wait for approval by Wikimedia.

4. Send your Wikimedia user name to the existing maintainers, so they
   can add you to the maintainers on
   [Toolforge](https://toolsadmin.wikimedia.org/tools/id/osmviews/maintainers/)   and [Cloud VPS](https://horizon.wikimedia.org/project/member/). The latter
   is needed because Wikimedia offers S3-compatible object storage only
   through OpenStack, not through Toolforge (as of May 2025).

5. Send your GitHub user name to the existing maintainers, so they
   can add you as collaborator on
   [GitHub](https://github.com/brawer/osmviews/settings/access).


# Remove maintainers

To remove a maintainer, remove their entry from [Toolforge](https://toolsadmin.wikimedia.org/tools/id/osmviews/maintainers/), [Horizon](https://horizon.wikimedia.org/project/member/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/brawer/osmviews/settings/access).
